The goal of ggdal is to ...


This is really just an experiment, it's very unclear to me if the gg-way really fits the GDAL warper, but i'm going to try because a graphics device should send messages to the GDAL library and not need a human intermediary. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggdal from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hypertidy/ggdal")
```

# TODO

* make useful
* use the extent from gdal info, consider xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax aes? 
* look at crs, use of coord_sf or can we just ggplot2 more basic
* probably, use coord_sf to set the grain and extent and crs ...





## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggdal)
## basic example code
```
